//Graph Valid Tree My Submissions Question Solution 
//Total Accepted: 2355 Total Submissions: 9208 Difficulty: Medium
//Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.
//
//For example:
//
//Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.
//
//Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.
//
//Hint:
//
//Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], what should your return? Is this case a valid tree? Show More Hint 
//Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
