//Longest Increasing Continuous subsequence
//
//        26% Accepted
//        Give you an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this array)ï¼Œfind the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array. (The definition of the longest increasing continuous subsequence here can be from right to left or from left to right)
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.
//
//        For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.
//
//        Note
//        O(n) time and O(1) extra space.
