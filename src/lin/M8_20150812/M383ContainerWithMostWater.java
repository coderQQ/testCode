//
//        40% Accepted
//        Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
// n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
// Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        Given [1,3,2], the max area of the container is 2.
//
//        Note
//        You may not slant the container.
