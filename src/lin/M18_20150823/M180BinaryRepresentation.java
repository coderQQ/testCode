//Binary Representation
//
//        17% Accepted
//        Given a (decimal - e.g. 3.72) number that is passed in as a string, return the binary representation that is passed in as a string. If the fractional part of the number can not be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, return ERROR.
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        For n = "3.72", return "ERROR".
//
//        For n = "3.5", return "11.1".
