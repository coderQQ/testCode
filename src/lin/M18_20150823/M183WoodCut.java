//Wood Cut
//
//        19% Accepted
//        Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        For L=[232, 124, 456], k=7, return 114.
//
//        Note
//        You couldn't cut wood into float length.
//
//        Challenge
//        O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.
