//Topological Sorting
//
//        25% Accepted
//        Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:
//
//        For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
//        The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.
//        Find any topological order for the given graph.
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        For graph as follow:
//
//        picture
//
//        The topological order can be:
//
//        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
//        [0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
//        ...
//        Note
//        You can assume that there is at least one topological order in the graph.
//
//        Challenge
//        Can you do it in both BFS and DFS?
