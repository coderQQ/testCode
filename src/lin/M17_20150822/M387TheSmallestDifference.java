//The Smallest Difference
//
//        35% Accepted
//        Given two array of integers(the first array is array A, the second array is array B),
// now we are going to find a element in array A which is A[i], and another element in array B which is B[j],
// so that the difference between A[i] and B[j] (|A[i] - B[j]|) is as small as possible,
// return their smallest difference.
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        For example, given array A = [3,6,7,4], B = [2,8,9,3], return 0
//
//        Challenge
