//Sort Colors
//
//        33% Accepted
//        Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue,
// sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
//
//        Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        Given [1, 0, 1, 2], return [0, 1, 1, 2].
//
//        Note
//        You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
//
//        Challenge
//        A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. First,
// iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's,
// then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
//
//        Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
