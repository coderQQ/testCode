//Longest Increasing Subsequence
//
//        25% Accepted
//        Given a sequence of integers, find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS).
//
//        You code should return the length of the LIS.
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        For [5, 4, 1, 2, 3], the LIS  is [1, 2, 3], return 3
//
//        For [4, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7], the LIS is [4, 4, 5, 7], return 4
//
//        Challenge
//        Time complexity O(n^2) or O(nlogn)
//
//        Clarification
//        What's the definition of longest increasing subsequence?
//
//        * The longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in
// which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest,
// and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
