//Gas Station
//
//        29% Accepted
//        There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
//
//        You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
//
//        Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        Given 4 gas stations with gas[i]=[1,1,3,1], and the cost[i]=[2,2,1,1]. The starting gas station's index is 2.
//
//        Note
//        The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
//
//        Challenge
//        O(n) time and O(1) extra space
