//Assignment Operator Overloading (C++ Only)
//
//        21% Accepted
//        Implement an assignment operator overloading method.
//
//        Make sure that:
//
//        The new data can be copied correctly
//        The old data can be deleted / free correctly.
//        We can assign like A = B = C
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        If we assign like A = B, the data in A should be deleted, and A can have a copy of data from B. If we assign like A = B = C, both A and B should have a copy of data from C.
//
//        Challenge
//        Consider about the safety issue if you can and make sure you released the old data.
//
//        Clarification
//        This problem is for C++ only as Java and Python don't have overloading for assignment operator.
