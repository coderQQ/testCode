//Distinct Subsequences
//
//        30% Accepted
//        Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.
//
//        A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some
//        (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
//        (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        Given S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit", return 3.
//
//        Challenge
//        Do it in O(n2) time and O(n) memory.
//
//        O(n2) memory is also acceptable if you do not know how to optimize memory.
