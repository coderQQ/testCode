//        29% Accepted
//        Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2.
// (each operation is counted as 1 step.)
//
//        You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
//
//        Insert a character
//        Delete a character
//        Replace a character
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        Given word1 = "mart" and word2 = "karma", return 3.
